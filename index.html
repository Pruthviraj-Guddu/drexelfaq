        <h2>Where to Live</h2>
        <p>There are several housing options available for students:</p>
        <p>keep in mind that There is no commission for finding housing</p>
        <p>
          there will be initial applicaton fee, you'll be asked to pay the first
          month rent, last month rent and security deposit(it will be refunded
          at the end)
        </p>
        <p>
          yes, you can share a room with another person, but they have to be
          added in the lease document. This may cost an additional $50 in rent.
          but it is safe to include them in the lease document. If The
          management gets to know they you had a person living under the same
          roof, without having them on the lease, will lead to fine or
          termination of the lease. (yes this happened, the fine was huge, then
          they had to vacate the house)
        </p>
        <p>

        <h3>things to consider while looking for a apartments</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Proximity to Drexel University</strong> Consider how close
            the apartment is to the Drexel University campus. Living within
            walking distance or a short commute can save time on transportation.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Safety</strong> Research the safety of the neighborhood.
            Look for low crime rates and safe streets. There are police patrols
            in some areas
          </li>
          <li>
            Most of the students live in Powelton, Pearl St, Baring St, Hamilton
            St, Spring Garden St (I lived here), Brandywine St and Haverford
            Ave. Try to stay within 39 th street, It gets shady beyond this
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Rental Costs</strong> Determine your budget and look for
            apartments that fit within it. Consider not only the rent but also
            utilities (water, electricity, internet) which may or may not be
            included. I lived in 3bed, 3bath, I paid $630 only for rent
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Furnished vs. Unfurnished</strong> Decide if you prefer a
            furnished or unfurnished apartment. Furnished apartments may be
            convenient for international students who don't want to buy
            furniture immediately.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Local Services and Shops</strong> Look for nearby grocery
            stores, pharmacies, restaurants, and other essential services.
            Convenience can make daily life easier.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Crime</strong></p>
        <p>
          There is another web page to see live crime like armed robbery and
          prisoner escpaed (kitten stuck on a tree)
          <a href="https://citizen.com/explore?q=philadelphia">citizen app</a>
          app is also avalable to give live updates

        <h3>Importance of Credit Cards</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Building Credit History:</strong> Establishing a credit
            history in the U.S. is crucial for future financial decisions, such
            as renting an apartment, buying a car, or applying for loans.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Convenience and Security:</strong> Credit cards offer a
            secure and convenient way to manage your finances, with the added
            benefit of fraud protection.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Financial Benefits:</strong> Many credit cards offer
            rewards, such as cash back, travel points, or other perks that can
            be beneficial for students
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          I started using Discover card as my first credit card, as it did not
          have ant previous record of credit score
        </p>
        <p>
          and one of my senior was kind enough to share a referal code, I got
          $100 so did they
          <br />this offer still exists<br />
          use this link
          <a href="https://refer.discover.com/pruthvigudduraj9!1d2834378d!a">
            https://refer.discover.com/s/pruthvigudduraj9
          </a>
          each of us will get $100 (sign up bonus for you, referal bonus for me)
        </p>
        <p>
          once we get credit score, we can apply for better credit cards (may
          take 9 months to ge the first score). <br />
          for more information, its called FICO Score.

        <h2>Health Insurance</h2>
        <p>
          Drexel University offers a health insurance plan through
          <b>UnitedHealthcare</b>.
        </p>
        <h4>Mandatory Health Insurance</h4>
        <p>
          All full-time students at Drexel University, including international
          students, are required to have health insurance. You must either
          enroll in the Drexel-sponsored health insurance plan or provide proof
          of comparable coverage to waive the university plan
        </p>
        <a
          href="https://drexel.edu/counselingandhealth/insurance-immunizations/health-insurance/"
          >Further reading here</a
        >
        <p>
          In other words, here's how it works, you buy an insurance, Drexel says
          its valid or not, If it is valid and they accept it, you're good to
          go. If not, they will create more complications.
        </p>

        <h4>Drexel-Sponsored Health Insurance Plan</h4>
        <p>
          Drexel University offers a health insurance plan through
          UnitedHealthcare, known as the Dragon Plan. This plan provides
          comprehensive coverage, including emergency and non-emergency care,
          inpatient and outpatient services, mental health and substance abuse
          treatment, and coverage for pre-existing conditions
          <a
            href="https://drexel.edu/~/media/Files/counselingandhealth/HII/medical-summary-brochure-quarter-students.ashx?la=en"
            >Further reading here</a
          >
        </p>

        <h4>Costs</h4>
        <p>
          The annual cost for the Dragon Plan for the 2023-2024 academic year is
          $2,958 for individual students. Additional costs apply if you need
          coverage for dependents
        </p>

        <h3>
          Alternative Health Insurance Options (I am not recommending them, just
          to give you guys an idea)
        </h3>
        <p>
          when in doubt, always email the drexel health, to check if this falls
          under requiremnet before purchase
        </p>
        <p>
          Several providers offer health insurance plans that <b>may</b> meet
          Drexel's requirements and could be more affordable than the
          university-sponsored plan:
        </p>

              ></strong
            >

            than university-sponsored plans. They provide comprehensive coverage
            and can assist with the waiver process
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>
              <a href="https://www.internationalstudentinsurance.com/"

            >
            Provides reliable and affordable plans designed to meet visa
            requirements and university standards. They offer multiple plan
            levels to suit different budgets and needs
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Waiving the Drexel Plan</h4>
        <p>
          If you choose to use an alternative health insurance plan, it must
          meet specific criteria set by Drexel University. The alternative plan
          must:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Provide coverage for emergency and non-emergency care in the Drexel
            area.
          </li>
          <li>Include mental health and substance abuse coverage.</li>
          <li>Offer a policy year maximum of at least $500,000.</li>
          <li>
            Be provided by a company licensed to do business in the U.S. with a
            U.S. claims payment office and phone number.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Applying for a Waiver</h4>
        <p>
          To apply for a waiver, you need to submit proof of your alternative
          insurance plan to Drexel University by the specified deadline. The
          university will review your plan to ensure it meets their
          requirements. If approved, you will not be enrolled in the
          Drexel-sponsored plan, and the premium will not be charged to your
          student account
        </p>

        <p>
          By understanding these requirements and exploring your options, you
          can make an informed decision about your health insurance coverage
          while studying at Drexel University.

        <h2>Courses related questions</h2>
        <p>close perspective from Master in Computer Science</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Q: Can we add or drop courses after we submit it:</strong>
            <br />
            You can drop any time (it's called web-drop) till the class start
            <br />
            There is also one more You can drop out of class after first class
            (one class) suppose you didn't like it or some other reason
            <br />
            Worst case: there is one more option called 'course withdrawal',
            doing this when student are 100% sure student are gonna get F, doing
            so the student will lose mostly 80% of course fee or full (I don't
            know), but not a F, neither the credits will be counted.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong
              >Q: I am planning to take different courses and wanted to know if
              I can, what other option do I have :</strong
            >
            <br />

            You can If your pre requsits are wavered You won't have restrictions
            to take other cource<br />

            But by the end of your masters you will need to take all the
            required coursed<br />

            For example If you are persuing masters in computer science<br />

            You should meet all your course requirements by the end (after 1.5
            year course ) The order Dosent matter<br />

            You will also have to have 45 credits minimum<br />

            Keep in mind that some courcces are not given In perticualr
            quarters<br />

            (I would recommend taking different, last time not many took
            computer networks, but it was a core, there were not many seats in
            the class for all the students The other subject was bad ü§Æ )<br />
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong
              >Q: after registering for courses when do we have to pay the fees
              for the quarter?:</strong
            >
            <br />
            Within 2 weeks of registration.<br />
            Else there will be a small fine
            <br />
            Don't worry
            <br />
            This fine can be wavered on the first fee
            <br />

            Once you come here, go to office and tell that it's your first time
            paying fee You can get it wavered
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong
              >Q: how do we know how much to pay? Like where is it
              mentioned?:</strong
            >
            <br />
            3 courses will be around $13,000
            <br />
            It will be on the Drexel One Connect website.

            Balances
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              There are few chances if the cource don't have minimum
              registration, they may cancel the cource for that quarter
            </p>
            <strong>Q: then what do we do:</strong>
            <br />
            No (you don't have to worry much at this point ) <br />You'll get a
            mail if the cource is canceled
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Q: What to do if the class is full ?:</strong>
            <br />
            apply to waiting list
            <br />
            you will receive a mail sayig there is a slot

            >
            <br />
            No. <br />
            Sometimes the professors will only give the pdf (very rare that you
            will have to use textbook )
            <br />
            Mostly its Google search, Papaer reading
            <br />
            Youtube and other media

            >
            <br />
            <p>CS 543 Operating Systems (I have heard its bad)</p>
            <p>
              CS 544 Computer Networks too good, taught by Brian Mitchell (he is
              one of my favorite in whole Drexel life ü§©)

            <br />
            Yes, it can be ‚ÄúUNWAVERED‚Äù and will be counted for credits
            <br />
            you need to drop a mail to academic advisor
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Q: What gpa is easily achievable:</strong>
            <br />

          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Q: how is plagiarism in Drexel:</strong>
            <br />
            Here in Drexel, plagiarism is taken very seriously<br />
            So not take any other assignment <br />
            never ever share the assignment <br />
            not even a small chunk of code <br />
            <br />
            wll all have 2 strikes for plagiarism <br />
            for the first strike its noted and reported üò†<br />
            but for the second strike, deported üò° (zero tolerance) <br />
            <br />
            I am super super super super super super serious

        <h2>Additional miscellaneous questions</h2>
        <p>para text</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>what for breakfast ?</strong>We usually have Cheerios
            <a
              href="https://www.amazon.com/Cheerios-Breakfast-Cereal-Gluten-Free/dp/B019Z95UCO"

              Cheerios </a
            >. with milk. Peanut butter and bread. oats.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>milk is bad compared to India</strong> the milk has no
            taste, its like water.
            <a
              href="https://giantfood.com/groceries/dairy/milk/whole-milk/giant-whole-vitamin-d-milk-1-gallon.html"
            >
              Giant Whole </a
            >. dosent have milk smell either.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>vegetables:</strong>less variety. what I miss the most is
            Okra, bitter gourd, Drumstick, Jackfruit, curry leaves. dont worry,
            some of it is available in International Store.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>paneer (milk product):</strong> is available in Indian
            store, but its far more expensive than chicken.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Clothes washing:</strong> most apartment have in unit washer
            and dryer. I felt its nice because it takes 30 minutes for washing
            and another 60 minutes for drying. in other words, I can wash my bed
            sheets in the morning and use the same sheets the same afternoon.
            (crisp dryed). But the down side is if the cloths are not filly
            dried, its difficult to dry them in the room, due to AC the cloths
            wont dry. (If it is a little damp, I will just use iron box üòÖ)
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Plants in the room:</strong> I love plants, but not many
            indoor plants survive in the room, it is rare that we open the
            windows, limited sunlight. as far as i have seen there are very few
            plants which survive indoor.
            <ul>
              <li>POTHOS (Epipremnum aureum) commonly knows as money plant</li>
              <li>SPIDER PLANT (Chlorophytum comosum) one of my favorite</li>
            </ul>
            in other words, less ü™¥

            <strong>Time zone </strong>Philadelphia is in the Eastern Time Zone
            (ET) of the United States. This time zone is 5 hours behind
            Coordinated Universal Time (UTC-5) <br />
            India, on the other hand, uses Indian Standard Time (IST), which is
            UTC+5:30. <br />
            So, the time difference between Philadelphia and India varies
            depending on whether Daylight Saving Time is in effect in
            Philadelphia:
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong
                  >During Standard Time (roughly early November to
                  mid-March):</strong
                >Philadelphia is 10 hours and 30 minutes behind India.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong
                  >During Daylight Saving Time (roughly mid-March to early
                  November):</strong
                >Philadelphia is 9 hours and 30 minutes behind India.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          For example, if it's 12:00 PM (afternoon) in Philadelphia, it would be
          10:30 PM or 9:30 PM in India, depending on whether Daylight Saving
          Time is in effect.

        <p>
          Starting your journey as an international student can be both exciting
          and daunting. <br />
          I understand the challenges international students face <br />
          It can feel incredibly lonely and homesick, especially coming from a
          close-knit family in India. <br />
          Having completed my master&#39;s at Drexel University, I can relate to
          these feelings. <br />It's important to remember that you&#39;re not
          alone in this experience. Many of us have faced similar challenges and
          have found ways to cope and thrive. <br />We are here to support you

          I know, it may not make much sense, day light is messed up, people
          don't talk, they get attitude issues. The overall experience can feel
          like a rollercoaster ride‚Äîfull of ups and downs.
