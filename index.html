        <h2>Where to Live</h2>
        <p>There are several housing options available for students:</p>
        <p>keep in mind that there is no commission for finding houses</p>
        <p>
          there will be initial applicaton fee, you'll be asked to pay the first
          month rent, last month rent and security deposit(it will be refunded
          at the end)
        </p>
        <p>
          yes, you can share a room with another person, but they have to be
          added in the lease document. this may cost additional $50 on the rent.
          but it is safe to include them in the lease document. If the managmant
          gets to know they you had a person living under the same roof, without
          having them on the lease, will lead to fine or termination of the
          lease. (yes this happened, the fine was huge, then they had to vacate
          the house)
        </p>
        <p>
          there are mainly 3 official Drexel affiliated housing ü§Æ Chestnut
          Square (I lived here initially,

          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>things to consider while looking for a appartments</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Proximity to Drexel University</strong> Consider how close
            the apartment is to the Drexel University campus. Living within
            walking distance or a short commute can save time on transportation.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Safety</strong> Research the safety of the neighborhood.
            Look for low crime rates and safe streets. there are police patrol
            in some aras
          </li>
          <li>
            most of the studnts live in Powelton, Pearl St, Baring St, Hamilton
            St, Spring Garden St (I lived here), Brandywine St and Haverford
            Ave. Try to stay within 39 th street, it gets shady beond this
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Rental Costs</strong> Determine your budget and look for
            apartments that fit within it. Consider not only the rent but also
            utilities (water, electricity, internet) which may or may not be
            included. I lived in 3bed, 3bath, I paid $630 only for rent
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Furnished vs. Unfurnished</strong> Decide if you prefer a
            furnished or unfurnished apartment. Furnished apartments may be
            convenient for international students who don't want to buy
            furniture immediately.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Local Services and Shops</strong> Look for nearby grocery
            stores, pharmacies, restaurants, and other essential services.
            Convenience can make daily life easier.

          you sign a contract for a year, they will give you a brand new phone

          you will get a barcode, scan the barcode before you scan your item.
          (there will be price difference for vegetables and fruits)
        </p>
        <p>
          else you can just use the below barcode (its free to create an
          account, there is no use of the app once you create account)

        <h2>Health insurence</h2>
        <p>
          Drexel University offers a health insurance plan through
          <b>UnitedHealthcare</b>.
        </p>
        <h4>Mandatory Health Insurance</h4>
        <p>
          All full-time students at Drexel University, including international
          students, are required to have health insurance. You must either
          enroll in the Drexel-sponsored health insurance plan or provide proof
          of comparable coverage to waive the university plan
        </p>
        <a
          href="https://drexel.edu/counselingandhealth/insurance-immunizations/health-insurance/"
          >further reading here</a
        >
        <p>
          in other basic words, how it works is, you buy an insurance, Drexel
          says its valid or not, if it is valid and they accept it. you are left
          in peace, if not they will do a another mess
        </p>

        <h4>Drexel-Sponsored Health Insurance Plan</h4>
        <p>
          Drexel University offers a health insurance plan through
          UnitedHealthcare, known as the Dragon Plan. This plan provides
          comprehensive coverage, including emergency and non-emergency care,
          inpatient and outpatient services, mental health and substance abuse
          treatment, and coverage for pre-existing conditions
          <a
            href="https://drexel.edu/~/media/Files/counselingandhealth/HII/medical-summary-brochure-quarter-students.ashx?la=en"
            >further reading here</a
          >
        </p>

        <h4>Costs</h4>
        <p>
          The annual cost for the Dragon Plan for the 2023-2024 academic year is
          $2,958 for individual students. Additional costs apply if you need
          coverage for dependents
        </p>

        <h3>
          Alternative Health Insurance Options (I am not recomending them, just
          to give you guys an idea)
        </h3>
        <p>
          when in doubt, always email the drexel health, to check if this falls
          under requiremnet before purchase
        </p>
        <p>
          Several providers offer health insurance plans that <b>may</b> meet
          Drexel's requirements and could be more affordable than the
          university-sponsored plan:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>
              <a
                href="https://www.americanvisitorinsurance.com/student-insurance/colleges/drexel-university.asp"
                >Visitor Insurance:</a
              ></strong
            >
            Offers various plans for international students that can be cheaper
            than university-sponsored plans. They provide comprehensive coverage
            and can assist with the waiver process
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>
              <a href="https://www.internationalstudentinsurance.com/"
                >International Student Insurance (ISI):</a
              ></strong
            >
            Provides reliable and affordable plans designed to meet visa
            requirements and university standards. They offer multiple plan
            levels to suit different budgets and needs
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Waiving the Drexel Plan</h4>
        <p>
          If you choose to use an alternative health insurance plan, it must
          meet specific criteria set by Drexel University. The alternative plan
          must:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Provide coverage for emergency and non-emergency care in the Drexel
            area.
          </li>
          <li>Include mental health and substance abuse coverage.</li>
          <li>Offer a policy year maximum of at least $500,000.</li>
          <li>
            Be provided by a company licensed to do business in the U.S. with a
            U.S. claims payment office and phone number.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Applying for a Waiver</h4>
        <p>
          To apply for a waiver, you need to submit proof of your alternative
          insurance plan to Drexel University by the specified deadline. The
          university will review your plan to ensure it meets their
          requirements. If approved, you will not be enrolled in the
          Drexel-sponsored plan, and the premium will not be charged to your
          student account
        </p>

        <p>
          By understanding these requirements and exploring your options, you
          can make an informed decision about your health insurance coverage
          while studying at Drexel University.
